            My name is <strong>Hyeonkyeong Park</strong>. People call me <strong>Joy</strong> or <strong>Park</strong>. I came from South Korea. It has been almost 11months since my husband and I came to Canada. We just had the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the wedding last December here.<br>
            We have a dream of volunteering work to help people in a needed area. Because we know the saying, <blockquote>“There is more happiness in giving than there is in receiving.”-<cite>Acts 20:35</cite></blockquote>So we are preparing slowly little by little to make our dream comes true.

            Telling about me, there is good information that analyzed my personality well. My <abbr title="Myers Briggs Type Indicator">MBTI</abbr> Test personality is <em>INFP</em>. It means I possess the <b>INTROVERTED</b>, <b>INTUITIVE</b>, <b>FEELING</b>, and <b>PROSPECTING</b> personality traits. I look quiet and unassuming, but I’m curious and motivated inside. So I like learning and trying something new. And I need time to get close at the first meeting since I am introverted. But after getting close, I love to empathize and communicate with others.
